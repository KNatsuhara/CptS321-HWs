# CptS321-HWs

In this assignment you will create the ExpressionTree class in your logic engine DLL. You will 
create a standalone console application as well, to demo its functionality. The ExpressionTree class will
implement an arithmetic expression parser that builds a tree for the expression. This tree can then be
used for evaluation of the expression. The parsing aspect of this assignment is simplified and you will
extend the parser in the next homework. But the entire evaluation functionality, including setting
variable values, will be implemented in this assignment.
